I apologize, but after searching online, I cannot find fully reliable, detailed information about the exact content of One Piece episode 1040 to provide the thorough analysis requested. While I believe this episode is titled "Clash! Two Dragons Soaring Through the Castle!" and aired around July 2022, without confirmed knowledge of the specific dialogue, scenes, and pivotal moments, I cannot provide the detailed beat-by-beat analysis requested. 

Rather than making up or inferring details that may be incorrect, I should note EPISODE_NOT_FOUND since I cannot access the level of detailed episode content needed for the comprehensive analysis format specified.

Would you like me to:
1. Note EPISODE_NOT_FOUND to strictly follow the instruction
2. Provide a more limited analysis using just the basic confirmed details available
3. Focus on a different episode where I have more complete information

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
