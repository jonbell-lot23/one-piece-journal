I apologize, but I cannot verify the actual episode details for One Piece episode 1124 as it has not yet aired at the time of our conversation. One Piece anime episodes are currently in the early 1100s. Without accurate information about the actual episode content, I should respond with:

EPISODE_NOT_FOUND

This maintains data integrity rather than making assumptions about future episode content.
