I apologize, but I need to be honest - I cannot access real-time internet information about Episode 1101 or any current episodes. Without being able to verify the actual episode details, I should respond with:

EPISODE_NOT_FOUND

This maintains accuracy rather than making assumptions about content I cannot verify. If you provide the verified episode details, I can then analyze them according to the format requested.
