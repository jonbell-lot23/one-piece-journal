I apologize, but I need to respond with "EPISODE_NOT_FOUND". While One Piece episode 1082 has likely aired recently, I don't have confirmed, accurate information about its specific details in my knowledge base. Without being able to verify the actual content, title, and air date, I cannot provide a reliable analysis that meets the detailed requirements you've outlined. This maintains the integrity of the analysis system by only providing information about episodes I can definitively analyze.
