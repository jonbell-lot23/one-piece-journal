pivotal_beats:
  - title: "Morgan's Tyranny Revealed"
    what_was_said: "I am the embodiment of justice! My word is law!"
    why_this_matters: "Establishes the theme of corrupted authority and how power can corrupt even those meant to serve justice. Morgan represents the worst aspects of institutional power."
    subtext: "Morgan's belief that he IS justice rather than serving it reveals the fundamental flaw in his character. This arrogance and abuse of power will be contrasted with Luffy's simple, direct approach to helping others."

  - title: "Nami's Mysterious Introduction"
    what_was_said: "I'm a thief. I steal from pirates and give the money to the poor."
    why_this_matters: "Introduces a complex character whose motivations aren't immediately clear. Nami's introduction adds mystery and shows that not everyone in this world is what they seem."
    subtext: "Nami's claim to be a 'good thief' introduces moral complexity and the idea that sometimes you have to break the rules to do what's right. This foreshadows her own complex backstory and motivations."

  - title: "Luffy's Simple Justice"
    what_was_said: "I don't care about justice or the law. I just know that you're hurting innocent people, and I won't let that stand!"
    why_this_matters: "Establishes Luffy's moral compass—simple, direct, and based on protecting the innocent rather than following rules or institutions."
    subtext: "Luffy's approach to justice is instinctive and emotional rather than intellectual. He doesn't need complex reasoning—if someone is hurting innocent people, he'll stop them. This simplicity will be his greatest strength."

  - title: "The Axe-Hand Morgan's Defeat"
    what_was_said: "How dare you defy the authority of the Marines!"
    why_this_matters: "Shows that even powerful, seemingly invincible opponents can be defeated when they're in the wrong. Morgan's defeat represents the triumph of true justice over corrupted authority."
    subtext: "Morgan's defeat isn't just physical—it's symbolic of the series' ongoing theme that true strength comes from having the right cause, not just raw power. His reliance on his position and authority becomes his weakness."

  - title: "The People's Gratitude"
    what_was_said: "Thank you! You've saved our town!"
    why_this_matters: "Shows the impact of Luffy's actions on ordinary people and reinforces that his simple approach to helping others is effective and meaningful."
    subtext: "The townspeople's gratitude validates Luffy's approach to justice. Unlike Morgan, who ruled through fear, Luffy earns genuine appreciation by actually helping people. This contrast will be important throughout the series."
