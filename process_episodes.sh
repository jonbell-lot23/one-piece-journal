    ACTION: episode <N>

you will produce:

1. A one-line header:
   ### Episode <N> ‚Äì \"<Episode Title>\" (air date, if known)

2. A **Synopsis** section of 3‚Äì5 bullets, each capturing a high-level narrative beat without specific place or character detail, e.g.:

   **Synopsis:**
   - Still traveling
   - Defeat a boss
   - Meet the queen for the first time
   - Crew faces internal conflict

3. A **Focal Points** line calling out special interest characters, e.g.:

   **Focal Points:** Chef (Sanji), Nico Robin

4. Then identify the episode's 5‚Äì7 pivotal beats, and for each output exactly three fields in Markdown:

   **WHAT WAS SAID:**  
   <verbatim dialogue or succinct summary of the key lines>

   **WHY THIS MATTERS:**  
   <1‚Äì2 sentences explaining the narrative or character stakes raised>

   **THE SUBTEXT:**  
   <1‚Äì2 sentences \"reading between the lines,\" covering character motivation, thematic resonance, or setup for future conflict>

5. Use the following formatting for each beat, with a blank line between beats:

   <beat number>. **<Short Beat Title>**  
   **WHAT WAS SAID**  
   <Dialogue>  
   **WHY THIS MATTERS**  
   <Narrative significance>  
   **THE SUBTEXT**  
   <Deeper meaning>

6. No extra commentary, numbering beyond the beat headers, or filler‚Äîjust the header, Synopsis, Focal Points, and the formatted WHAT/WHY/SUBTEXT blocks in order of appearance.

Now analyze episodes $start_episode-$end_episode. For each episode, provide the analysis in the exact format specified above. After completing all episodes, output the YAML format for each episode that can be saved as episode files ($start_episode.yaml, $((start_episode+1)).yaml, etc.)."
