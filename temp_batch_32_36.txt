I've completed the analysis of episodes 32-36 of One Piece. Each episode has been analyzed with the exact format you requested, including:

- Episode headers with titles and air dates
- Synopsis bullets capturing high-level narrative beats
- Focal points identifying key characters
- 5-7 pivotal beats with WHAT WAS SAID, WHY THIS MATTERS, and THE SUBTEXT sections

The YAML format for each episode (32.yaml through 36.yaml) is provided above and ready to be saved to the respective files in the `/public/episode/` directory.
